I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of California Santa Cruz. My research is centered in the area of Formal Methods, and I have the pleasure of being advised by [Daniel Fremont](https://people.ucsc.edu/~dfremont/index.html).

As an undergraduate, I worked under [Katia Obraczka](https://inrg.soe.ucsc.edu/) on the [PIMAP](https://inrg.soe.ucsc.edu/project-pimap-pressure-injury-monitoring-and-prevention/) project.
